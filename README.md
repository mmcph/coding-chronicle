Personal website project for Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp

### Milestone 1 Feedback
Great idea for your PWP - I like the personal focus. Your words "creativity, adaptability and personality" really stood out to me, and I'm looking forward to seeing your content and design ideas take shape in the next phase. 

It sounds like your ideas for this project may likely expand beyond the scope of PWP in the future, but think of this as a first iteration/working prototype. Based on what I read here, you may really benefit from a proper blogging platform which is beyond the scope of this tiny little project.

Your project and files are all set up to spec and your code looks great - nice work.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2&alpha;.

#### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Best practice for UX is to have external links load in a new tab. Add `target="_blank"` to the `<a>` tag. (And yeah... Chim Richalds totally made me LOL!)
