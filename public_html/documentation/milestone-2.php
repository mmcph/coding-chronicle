			<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This page will be a space in which I can document my progress as a coder during (and after) this bootcamp. I'll include links to github/social media/personal website and other things like reflective 'blog' posts, insights, and inspirations that I pick up along the way.</p>
			<p><strong>Audience:</strong> The intended audience of this page consists of anyone who might be interested in my journey as a coder. Ideally, a potential employer or client will see this page and immediately understand my programming chops.</p>
			<p><strong>Goals:</strong> My goal with this project is to create a space with which I can 'sell my skills'. The page will function as a living gallery of my progress in web development, and will showcase my skills for potential employers or clients.</p>
