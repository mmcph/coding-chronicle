		<h3><span class="subject">Purpose, Audience, and Goals</span></h3>
		<div class="container">
			<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This page will be a space in which I can document my progress as a coder during (and after) this bootcamp. I'll include links to github/social media/personal website and other things like reflective 'blog' posts, insights, and inspirations that I pick up along the way.</p>
			<p><strong>Audience:</strong> The intended audience of this page consists of anyone who might be interested in my journey as a coder. Ideally, a potential employer or client will see this page and immediately understand my programming chops.</p>
			<p><strong>Goals:</strong> My goal with this project is to create a space with which I can 'sell my skills'. The page will function as a living gallery of my progress in web development, and will showcase my skills for potential employers or clients.</p>

		<h3><span class="subject">Persona</span></h3>
		<div class="container">
			<p><strong>Name:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsSSfE87G_Y" title="The best fake name">Chim Richalds</a></p>
			<p><strong>Age:</strong> 34</p>
			<p><strong>Profession:</strong> Chim is the hiring manager for a web development firm. </p>
			<p><strong>Technology:</strong> 2016 Macbook Pro, latest macOS version</p>
			<p><strong>Attitude:</strong> Chim is a busy man, especially when a position opens up. He routinely views hundreds of resumes, so anything that can expedite the candidate selection process is welcome.</p>
			<p><strong>Frustrations:</strong> Looking at a person's github page is a great way to determine what sort of coder they are, but not much else about that person is revealed just by scouring their repos. In a world where coding is increasingly becoming a team effort, Chim needs a way to select prime applicants with characteristics that may not be evident in a git repo. As a hiring representative, he wants more information about candidates before he schedules the all-important interview.</p>
			<p><strong>Goals:</strong> Chim wants to be able to see more about an applicant than just their resume and github page. He wants to know about a person's creativity, adaptability, and personality - preferably in one place.</p>
			<p><strong>User Story:</strong> As a hiring manager, Chim wants to know more about applicants before he schedules interviews.</p>
