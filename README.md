Personal website project for Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp

### Milestone 1 Feedback
Great idea for your PWP - I like the personal focus. Your words "creativity, adaptability and personality" really stood out to me, and I'm looking forward to seeing your content and design ideas take shape in the next phase. 

It sounds like your ideas for this project may likely expand beyond the scope of PWP in the future, but think of this as a first iteration/working prototype. Based on what I read here, you may really benefit from a proper blogging platform which is beyond the scope of this tiny little project.

Your project and files are all set up to spec and your code looks great - nice work.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2&alpha;.

#### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Best practice for UX is to have external links load in a new tab. Add `target="_blank"` to the `<a>` tag. (And yeah... Chim Richalds totally made me LOL!)

### Milestone 2a Feedback
Unfortunately there are some big problems here: 
- There are no Mobile Wireframes included. 
- The required Contact Form is not included in the wireframes presented.
- Git commit/push history is out of sync with what is uploaded on the server and the last commit was 13 days ago. 
- Wireframe image(s) are not in the repository. 

Because the above are missing/not in line with project specs - I cannot pass this Milestone as is, and it only qualifies for [Tier I](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/) status.

The content strategy here is highly technical, and I think it will suffice for this project, but I will  note here that documented content strategies in industry are more nuanced and complex than this and take a more "holistic" approach. I realize that we don't approach this topic at anything beyond the most introductory level in this class, but I think you are at the level where you could have challenged yourself a bit further in this area.

Please refer to the project specs here for instructions, and complete all revisions by Thursday 5/10 8:00am and I'll bump your grade to Tier II:
